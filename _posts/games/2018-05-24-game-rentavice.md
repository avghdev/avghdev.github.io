Us OSXers are constantly given the short end of the stick when it comes to games. So, I thought I would post every once and awhile about games that you **can** play on your Mac! I'll be focusing on new and obscure games that most of you probably haven't heard of in order to be of actual help to those trying to find new Mac games to play.

This one is a text-based, story-driven game along the lines of a "Choose your own Adventure" book. I played the game once - it only took about two hours - and thoroughly enjoyed the eloquent prose and surprisingly vivid imagery that it evoked. I might even go back to see how the story will play out depending on which choices I make. While it is no GOTY, it is still a nice (and cheap) experience to contemplate for a couple of hours. Put on some jazzy, noir-esque music on and indulge yourself in this nifty socio-political mystery!

#### The Story

Imagine a world where you can experience life through another person. Virtual Reality but more visceral - more "real". What consequences might arise, and how might people try to exploit the system?

These questions, among others, are what [Choice of Games](https://www.choiceofgames.com/) ask in their new title "Rent-a-Vice". The story takes place in a futuristic, sci-fi city where people (dubbed "feeders") can relay real life experiences - such as cliff-diving, self-mutilation, and claustrophobic situations - virtually to "users" via a technology known as VE (Virtual Experience). The exact implications of this technology is left fairly hazy, but it is known that the technology can be exceedingly addictive for varying reasons.

The game puts you in the shoes of a Private Investigator, whose character you craft through choices semi-frequently proposed to you throughout the play-through. These choices are reflected in a typical character stat sheet that you can view at any point during the game. It is never outwardly revealed how your stats affect your interactions. They could be an illusion for all I know. At the very least, it did appear that my choices were reflected through stat changes, which gives you *some* satisfaction - if not entirely gratifying.

The story itself is interesting - taking a sinister view on the future that advanced Virtual Reality could create. It is clear however, that this game is more intent on getting a message across than anything else. While this is a respectable choice to make, the world is left slightly undeveloped as a result. For example, it is heavily implied throughout the game that you have some sort of history with VE - but the game never bothers to go past surface details with the main character (or with *any* character for that matter). Perhaps this is explored in more detail along some other path that I did not explore in my first run - but it seems unlikely.

Additionally, there were a few times where the story seemed to "forget" events that had happened. The most notable instance of this occurred when the game told me that the death of character A would be a heavy blow to character B. Rather curiously, however, character B had already died earlier in the story. This, I assert, would make it very difficult for them to be affected by character A's death - as they are already dead themselves!

Despite this, it was still an enjoyable read. The pacing is fast, and the writing is surprisingly enjoyable. This makes up for some of the shallow world-building, as you are not left too bored at any point, and the choices come frequently enough to keep you from skipping through chunks of dialogue at light-speed. There are even a few special moments in the game where you feel a huge sense of player agency - even if it was just an illusion. That's pretty impressive for a game that has no visuals other than text and buttons! All in all, I think the story is told very well through the medium it has chosen, and is definitely worth the relatively low price-tag.
