I finally got around to making my personal website, and let me tell you - it has been an ordeal. As a former web developer I was laser-focused on developing static websites from scratch. That meant using as little outside resources as possible. Bootstrap, JQuery, JavaScript - all were rejected in favor of an original and purely HTML/CSS solution. Obviously this greatly limited the variety of applications I could develop for the web. Despite learning a great deal (limiting yourself can occasionally be helpful), a project such as a blog seemed nearly impossible. Eventually I became frustrated with my self-imposed restrictions - but rather than submitting to the influence of dynamic webpages, I decided to move to object-oriented programming languages such as Java and C#.

I am taking a tentative step back into the world of web-development, however, due to my recent discovery of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). "What is this *Jekyll* thing?", you might ask. Well, in short it is a static website generator. That means that it takes text you write in **markdown** and/or **html** and converts it into a static webpage. There are several advantages to "*going static*", which Barry Clark outlines in [this awesome article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/):

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Simplicity.</b> Jekyll strips everything down to the bare minimum, eliminating a lot of complexity:
        <ul>   
            <li><b>No database.</b> Unlike WordPress and other content management systems (CMS), Jekyll doesn’t have a database. All posts and pages are converted to static HTML prior to publication. This is great for loading speed because no database calls are made when a page is loaded.</li>
            <li><b>No CMS.</b> Simply write all of your content in Markdown, and Jekyll will run it through templates to generate your static website. GitHub can serve as a CMS if needed because you can edit content on it.</li>
            <li><b>Fast.</b> Jekyll is fast because, being stripped down and without a database, you’re just serving up static pages. My base theme, Jekyll Now, makes only three HTTP requests — including the profile picture and social icons!</li>
            <li><b>Minimal.</b> Your Jekyll website will include absolutely no functionality or features that you aren’t using.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Design control.</b> Spend less time wrestling with complex templates written by other people, and more time creating your own theme or customizing an uncomplicated base theme.</li>
    <li><b>Security.</b> The vast majority of vulnerabilities that affect platforms like WordPress don’t exist because Jekyll has no CMS, database or PHP. So, you don’t have to spend as much time installing security updates.</li>
    <li><b>Convenient hosting.</b> Convenient if you already use GitHub, that is. GitHub Pages will build and host your Jekyll website at no charge, while simultaneously handling version control.</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

For me, the selling point was the sheer amount of control you have over the content and theme of your website. Because Jekyll is truly just converting your text into HTML, it is suprisingly trivial to make extremely nuanced changes to your site - granted that you have some knowledge of web development. Jekyll also allows you to write new content in a technical way. For example, I am currently writing this post in a mixture of markdown *and* inline html. The emphasis on the "and" in the previous sentence was made possible through markdown, while the block quote used above was generated through the `<blockquote>` tag. The ability to use these two tools in tandem has been a great joy thus far for me. This doesn't even scratch the surface of what jekyll is capable of, and I must admit that I'm still learning the various "ins-and-outs". This might be partly due to Jekyll's foundation in **Ruby**, a language I have not had the chance to become familiar with as of yet. I'll be sure to post more information and perhaps even some tutorials as I learn more. You can read about some of its features yourself in Jekyll's (very user-friendly) [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

#### Using Jekyll with GitHub

One of the most exciting parts of using Jekyll is it's compatibility with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). If you aren't already familiar with GitHub's wonderful hosting service, you should definately check it out. It's completely free, and allows you to host a wide variety of web applications and pages without the hassle of working with servers and ports. This website, as you might have noticed from the domain name, is hosted using their service. As a poor college student, the ability to host a personal website free of monthly subscription is a huge blessing.

While the setup was a bit convoluted, this has definately been worth the struggles. I plan on creating a small guide for setting up your own Jekyll website. Hopefully that will help some other less-technically inclined folk avoid the pitfalls I fell into while making this page.

Stay tuned!
