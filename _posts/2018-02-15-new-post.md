I finally got around to making my personal website, and let me tell you - it has been an ordeal. As a former web developer I was laser-focused on developing static websites from scratch. That meant using as little outside resources as possible. Bootstrap, JQuery, JavaScript - all were rejected in favor of an original and purely HTML/CSS solution. Obviously this greatly limited the variety of applications I could develop for the web. Despite learning a great deal (limiting yourself can occasionally be helpful), a project such as a blog seemed nearly impossible. Eventually I became frustrated with my self-imposed restrictions - but rather than submitting to the influence of dynamic webpages, I decided to move to object-oriented programming languages such as Java and C#.

I am taking a tentative step back into the world of web-development, however, due to my recent discovery of the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static website generator.
