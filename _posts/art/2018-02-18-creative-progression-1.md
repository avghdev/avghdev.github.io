Some of my close friends and family know that it is a dream of mine to work at Disney. I have held this aspiration for a relatively brief period of time. It came to me after a choir tour taken my senior year of high school to DisneyLand. My director was able to get us a tour of the studio - and I was blown away by the sheer *awesomeness* of their workplace. Since then it has been a goal of mine to eventually work with Disney to create one of their amazing worlds. Hence this post, which will hopefully be the first of many. One entry into the world of Disney (among many), is to be an excellent and creative writer. The idea is that writing short stories, such as this, will help me accomplish that.

You will probably notice that I am not very developed artistically: I'm bad at drawing, making music, and writing creative pieces. However, this is what I am trying to remedy in these posts. I have a lot of ideas swarming around in my head, now I need to learn how to convey them artistically. And that's why these posts will be entitled "Creative Progression". 

For those interested, these posts will, for the forseeable future, be based on Khan Academy's partner course with Pixar. You can see it for yourself [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/pixar/storytelling). The prompt for this piece was to try and express a memory and emotion in some way. This "memory" is *based* on a trip I took to Córdoba, Spain - but the atmosphere is the only thing true to reality. In short, it's fiction. So don't worry, I have no plans of disappearing into the Spanish countryside.

<h4> Binds of Society </h4>

<p>We crossed the moat of a sun-kissed bridge on rubber wheels, kneading medieval stone with the weight of our wonderment. Beneath us, shimmering water reflected excitement. The town ahead flaunted it’s modest buildings, dwarfing the skyscrapers of our motherland in it’s beauty.</p>

<p>A warm wind from the east or the north or the south caresses my face, as we are released from the confines of our metal concierge. The breeze kisses my lips - soft and tangible - and whirls away into the alluring, forbidden country. My legs are not chained but I am a prisoner all the same, bound to societal rules and commitments. Bound to “home”. And so I set aside my imagined affair with the gust, and submit myself to the diligently planned “adventure” that lies ahead. We enter the squat, unimposing, stone-built, city of my dreams. A horde of individuals - none of which speak English - shove around our intimidated blob of American privilege. Yet despite - and perhaps in spite - of this privilege, I crave that we switch lives, so that I may live among the history of centuries rather than the capitalism of decades. I detach from my designated cluster, now merely an atom in a foreign cell. As I shuffle alone through the streets my shoulders make intimate relations with people crowded around me.</p>

<p>A break in the mass allows me to take respite in a shadowed alley. My fingers trace the masonry as it whispers stories of creation, destruction, and rebirth. The path winds toward a small parlor, and I catch a flash of eyes. Eyes that the sea and the sky imitate. A flutter of the heart pulls me to the shop, and to an intrigue that would rival the wind’s. I am greeted by hair of ivory and skin of polished bronze. A brief quip reveals laughter that fills the air with nectar. I pay for an excuse and we pass the hours together. Me and Possibility, Possibility and I.</p>

<p>But then a text on my iPhone tells me that I must go. I must go. “Must”. What a terrible word.</p>
