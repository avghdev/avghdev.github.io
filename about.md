I have a lot of things I want to achieve. This website is a fluid space for me to echo these desires out into the empty void that is the "web".

As I have just turned 19, I have set 19 goals for myself. They will be listed here. I do not truly expect myself to achieve all, or even a majority of these challenges. However, as the saying goes, it is better to aim high and miss than to shoot low and hit.

#### 19 Goals for a 19 year old me

- **Exercise.** I know, this one is pretty broad. However I want to work towards achieving a few things in particular. **(Try to exercise every day)**
..- Work on getting my arms to look bigger (biceps and triceps)
..- Redefine my abs. A sixpack would be nice.
..- Become more flexible. I'm currently much like a t-rex trying to bend over.
..- Perhaps learn some gymnastics. I've especially always wanted to be capable of doing a standing backflip.
..- Posture. I have a minor case of "nerd neck", and despite the fitting name I would genuinely like to be rid of it.
..- Dancing. I love musical theatre, yet my horrid dancing has always made me feel as though I have fallen short.

- **Complete one coding project a month.** Depending on the scale and scope of each project, this could be either incredibly easy or extremely difficult to achieve. I guess we will find out! Currently I am hoping to write a program to assist with my *Starfinder* roleplaying campaign.

- **Read one book a month.** Pretty straight forward. I have already got a queue in place. Right now I am reading the very insightful *The Tao of Physics* by Frijtof Capra. Once I finish that, I plan to move on to a scifi classic: *Dune*.

- **Bring A1C down.** As a type one diabetic, this is an important health goal for me. My last A1C was 13% - which is pretty darn bad. Ideally I would love to get it down to 8%, but that might be difficult. Luckily, I just recieved my Dexcom G6 yesterday, which should hopefully help me manage my blood sugar!

- **Learn more jazz piano.** This one I am particularly eager to achieve, although it is definately up there with one of the hardest challenges I've set for myself. This will take a lot of practice, which is why I hope to **practice piano at least once a day*. However, I have not been able to start this particular task yet, as my piano is still in storage.

- **Build something every 3 months.** As many friends and family will attest, I am not a "handy man". I want to change this through building something - be it wood, metal, electronic - every three months. The idea is to get me more familiar with basic woodworking, metalworking, and general hardware tools.

- **Invest at least $500.** Money goes quickly with me. I can't help but buy lots of things with the money I make. Food is the true culprit. However, I will be happy if I can put away $500 into stocks or something else.

- **Write something substantial every 4 months.** I would consider myself a decent writer. Not anything amazing - but decent. It'd be really cool to be an amazing writer though, so I plan to practice my writing and show my projects through three big writing projects this year.

- **Create an artistic piece every week.** Be it a drawing, a painting, a sculpture, whatever. I simply want to improve my artistic ability, for it is currently severely lacking. This week I drew a simple shaded sphere. It's honestly pretty bad - but for me it's quite the improvement.

- **Cook/Bake something every week.** I am also lacking culinary skills. I assume that making something every week might fix that. Or at least show me a few dishes that I can make. This week I hope to make a gluten-free lasagna!

- **Learn Japanese.** I've wanted to learn Japanese for a long time now. I love the culture, the anime, the food, and the people. To achieve this I have bought a beginners text-book to guide me, as well as a book full of mnemonics to help me memorize the Kana and Kanji. I hope to *practice japanese every day* as well.

- **Participate in at least 12 competitions or events.** This may not be realistic, but it will keep me on my toes for sure. This means everything from hackathons, to scholarship competitions. Whatever I can do to show future employers that I am "successful".

- **Participate in at least 2 shows.** While I generally assume that these shows will be musicals, they don't have to be. Additionally, I don't necessarily have to be an actor in the shows either. I would love to help on stage in other ways too!

- **Develop a business pitch and plan.** While the business doesn't have to go anywhere, I am entrepenurial at heart and want to start getting some practice with business ideas. 

- **Create 1 2D and 1 3D animation.** The philosophy behind this is the same as that behind the artistic projects: simply to improve my ability to do these kinds of things. I think it would be awesome if I had the ability to make cool 2d and 3d animations. Realistically though, these things take time - which I do not always have a lot of. Thus I have only committed myself to one of each for this year.

- **Create 1 small 2D game and 1 small 3D game.** I genuinely want to make at least one game of my own, and I figured if I am going to make a 2d and 3d animation, I might as well use the skills I will likely learn doing that to make assets for a game! Again, games take time though so I have only committed to one of each.

- **Work on this website each week.** I'm prone to abandoning projects, but I don't want that to happen to this site at the very least. I believe it has potential, so I will try to keep updating it frequently as the year goes by.

- **Create and edit a video every 2 months.** I really like video editing, but I don't really get a chance to do it all that often. Therefore, I thought I would make it a mission to create and edit videos every two months. It's not so frequent that it will become a huge time suck, but frequent enough that any skills I learn are unlikely to atrophy.

- **Create a 3D model every two weeks.** As I do not have extensive training with 3D modeling, and two of my goals require it, I am going to attempt and learn it faster by creating a model every 2 weeks. We will see how it goes, as I may be vastly underestimating how feasible this is.
